# Docker-Guide
This repository takes you to a journey of learning a DevOps pillar called Docker. Docker has been around since some time now but has been gaining tremendous popularity. UPES-OPEN brings this program to help you get started with learning Docker.
Docker is a set of the platform as a service tools. It utilizes the concept of OS-level virtualization. The software is delivered in the form of packages called Containers. The OS-level virtualization is called containerization. One interesting thing about containers is that each container is isolated from each other. To reach the isolation each container is bundled with its own configuration and requirements. 
A container is the standard unit for software with all the code and required dependencies. This enables quick and reliable computation.
